### **Stash is a self-hosted webapp written in Go which organizes and serves your porn.**
![demo image](docs/readme_assets/demo_image.png)

* Stash gathers information about videos in your collection from the internet, and is extensible through the use of community-built plugins for a large number of content producers and sites.
* Stash supports a wide variety of both video and image formats.
* You can tag videos and find them later.
* Stash provides statistics about performers, tags, studios and more.

You can [watch a SFW demo video](https://vimeo.com/545323354) to see it in action.

For further information you can consult the [documentation](https://docs.stashapp.cc) or [read the in-app manual](ui/v2.5/src/docs/en).

## First Run
#### Windows Users: Security Prompt
Running the app might present a security prompt since the binary isn't yet signed. Bypass this by clicking "more info" and then the "run anyway" button.
#### FFMPEG
Stash requires ffmpeg. If you don't have it installed, Stash will download a copy for you. It is recommended that Linux users install `ffmpeg` from their distro's package manager.

# Usage

## Quickstart Guide
Stash is a web-based application. Once the application is running, the interface is available (by default) from http://localhost:9999.

On first run, Stash will prompt you for some configuration options and media directories to index, called "Scanning" in Stash. After scanning, your media will be available for browsing, curating, editing, and tagging.

Stash can pull metadata (performers, tags, descriptions, studios, and more) directly from many sites through the use of [scrapers](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/tree/develop/ui/v2.5/src/docs/en/Scraping.md), which integrate directly into Stash.

Many community-maintained scrapers are available for download from [CommunityScrapers repository](https://github.com/stashapp/CommunityScrapers). The community also maintains StashDB, a crowd-sourced repository of scene, studio, and performer information, that can automatically identify much of a typical media collection. Inquire in the Discord for details. Identifying an entire collection will typically require a mix of multiple sources. 

<sub>[StashDB](http://stashdb.org) is the canonical instance of our open source metadata API, [stash-box](https://github.com/stashapp/stash-box).</sub>
